Welcome!

Modify my_bot.js to start writing your bot. Opening game.html will allow you to generate random boards, and either watch your bot play or step through one move at a time. Refer to http://scribd.com/job_game/api for available methods. gl/hf!

Scribd.

ps: you should be able to ignore everything in assets/, but if you want to disable the opponent bot from playing in game.html, go to assets/simple_bot.js and find:
    make_move: function() {
       // to disable to opponent, uncomment the next line
       // return PASS;

Uncomment the "return PASS;" and your bot will be free to roam the baord alone.
